        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 15, 2026</p>

        <p>DelayGuard ("we," "our," or "us") is operated by Pioneer Feeders LLC. This privacy policy explains how our Shopify application collects, uses, stores, and protects information when you install and use DelayGuard.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Through Shopify's APIs:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Store information (shop name, domain, timezone, currency)</li>
            <li>Order and fulfillment data (order numbers, fulfillment status, tracking numbers, carrier information, shipping addresses)</li>
            <li>Customer information associated with orders (name, email address, shipping address) for the purpose of sending delay notification emails</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Directly from merchants:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account preferences and app settings (delay thresholds, notification templates, timezone preferences)</li>
            <li>Contact email for account communications</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Automatically generated:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shipment tracking status updates retrieved from carrier APIs (UPS, FedEx, USPS)</li>
            <li>Delay detection records and resolution audit trails</li>
            <li>App usage logs for debugging and performance monitoring</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>From merchants' customers:</strong></p>
        <p>We do not collect information directly from merchants' customers. We do not drop cookies, use tracking pixels, or employ any tracking technologies on merchant storefronts. DelayGuard operates entirely within the Shopify admin and has no customer-facing storefront components.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect solely to provide and improve DelayGuard's services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitoring shipment status and detecting delivery delays</li>
            <li>Displaying shipment data on your DelayGuard dashboard</li>
            <li>Sending delay notification emails to your customers on your behalf when you initiate them</li>
            <li>Maintaining resolution records and audit trails</li>
            <li>Communicating with you about your account, billing, and app updates</li>
            <li>Improving app performance and fixing bugs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your information for advertising, marketing to your customers, or any purpose unrelated to providing DelayGuard's core functionality. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data or your customers' personal data with third parties for their own purposes.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>To provide delay detection, we send tracking numbers to carrier APIs (UPS, FedEx, USPS) to retrieve shipment status updates. Only the tracking number is transmitted; no customer personal information is shared with carriers through our app. Our app is hosted on Railway and uses PostgreSQL for data storage. These service providers process data on our behalf and are bound by their own privacy and security policies.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your shipment and order data for as long as your app subscription is active. Delivered shipments are automatically archived after 30 days (configurable in settings). When you uninstall DelayGuard, we will delete all store data, order data, and customer data from our systems within 48 hours of receiving Shopify's shop/redact webhook. Aggregated, anonymized usage statistics may be retained for product improvement purposes.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including encrypting data in transit using TLS/SSL, storing data in secured, access-controlled databases, using Shopify's OAuth and session token authentication, and limiting internal access to data on a need-to-know basis. While we strive to protect your information, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the email address below. We will respond to your request within 30 days.</p>
        <p>If you are a merchant's customer and wish to exercise your data rights, please contact the merchant directly. We will assist merchants in fulfilling data subject requests as required.</p>
        <p>We comply with Shopify's mandatory compliance webhooks, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>customers/data_request</strong> — We provide all stored data related to a specific customer upon request.</li>
            <li><strong>customers/redact</strong> — We delete all stored data related to a specific customer.</li>
            <li><strong>shop/redact</strong> — We delete all stored data related to a store after app uninstallation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Our servers are located in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using DelayGuard, you consent to this transfer. We take steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy regardless of where it is processed.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>DelayGuard is a business tool designed for Shopify merchants. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy on this page and updating the effective date. Your continued use of DelayGuard after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
